Description: Using a sampling-based approach (either sequential importance sampling or explicit Monte Carlo), this package can be used to perform a probabilistic damage tolerance for aircraft structures. It can model a single crack, or two simultaneously growing fatigue cracks (the so-called continuing damage problem). With a single crack, multiple types of future repairs are possible.
